Hi All,

Attached is the component I have modified to include two new properties.

MessageType     - which allows you to select HTML or plain text.
AttachmentType - which allows you to set how attachments are displayed in
the HTML document.

Please backup your original copy if you decide to use this update, as I
accept no responsibility for anything etc.etc.etc.

Also added is a new line, "ContentID"  which is written in the attachment
header giving the name of the file.

For example if you attach an imaged called hello.bmp then you can reference
this in the HTML message as

<B>This is a hello world HTML Message</B>
<P>
<img src="cid:hello.bmp">
<P>

I have also attached the shell of a new helpfile for the Saki mail units, if
you would like to contribute to any of the units properties or methods,
please post in here first to say which item you will do, then email the
completed task as a text file and I will paste it in.

Regards,
Greg
