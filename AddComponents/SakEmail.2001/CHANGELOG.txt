History:

0.9		
- First released version

0.9.1b	
-Fixed when a mail server reply on the connection with 
 more than one line

0.9.2b	
- I forget to return a value in functions 
  retrieveHeader/Message =)
  and fixed it. Some minor bugs that I don't remember fixed.
- Added MIME-compliant base64 support (not for use by now).
  Added examples.

0.9.2.1b
- Fixed a bug when send a mail and the first line disappear 
  (thanks to Arun)
- Now, you could do MySMTP.MsgTo := 'a@doma.com; b@domb.com;c@domc.com';
  the spaces before/after semicolon doesn't matter (I hope ;)).

0.9.3b
- Many changes, I added a SakMsg component that make send binary
  attachments a snap. But have one problem, if you send as 
  attach a file > 20 Kb, it doesn't work (I don't know why,
  maybe a problem of sockets). Developed with a version 2.0b of 
  WSockets and D3.

0.9.3.1b
- Changed the POP.login to a function that return the number of 
  new msgs.
- Added the event OnRetrieveProgress on the SakPOP, and fixed 
  the example, sorry =)
- Minor changes to the code.

1.0
- Developed with WSockets 1.2
  POP.Login now return a boolean depending id the user is
  authorized, and POP.Init return the number of new msgs.

1.01
- Fixed a bug with a bounced mail.

1.02
- Minor bugs fixed (some variants of boundary)
14/10/97

1.1.0
- Warning: WSockets1.2 have some bugs that result in 
  bad attachments. So I decided to use the sockets of
  Delphi 3 founded in D3 c/s D3.01 pro and D3.01 c/s.
  Now all seems to work fine and much more smooth.
  And of course the interface of SakEmail hasn't changed.
26/10/97

1.2.0
- Added the Reply-To field to TSakMsg comp.
  Now you must use ',' when you want to send the msg. to
  multiple recipients, i.e.: 'a@doma.com, b@domb.com,c@domc.com'
  This change is done for better compatibility with other
  emails clients.
- Better formatting of the field Date of TSakMsg.
  Some changes to the code.
17/11/97

1.2.1
- Now, all searches are made in case-insensitive, it could
  prevent some unexpected responses (no one reported, but...).
  Some changes to the code (again).
20/11/97

1.2.2
- Some bugs fixed. (Thanks to Serge Wagener from .lu)
24/11/97

1.2.3
- Added the field 'MIME-Version: 1.0'.
  It seems that is necessary :)
25/11/97

1.3.0
- Added compatibility with SCO and VAX servers.
  Fixed a minor bug with the boundary.
- Change the generator of the message id.
- Added the field MessageId and InReplyTo to the TSakMsg
  component.
- Added the field In-Reply-To that is added to the message
  generated when it is <> ''.
30/11/97

1.3.1
- Almost rewrote the parsing code. Now is more easy for you
  if you want hack/modify the code.
- Better treatment of emails with html inside.
15/12/97

1.4
- Added support for UUCoded attachments.
- Added a small delay when sending the email, seems that some 
  servers can't deglut the info too fast, causing problems with 
  sockets buffers and leading to crash the client machine, I 
  don't know if is a Borland bug or Microsoft bug.
  (thanks to Don Higgins).
19/12/97

1.4.1
- Fixed a bug that send double '<' and '>' (ie. <<ser@dom.com>>)
  when the full user name is used. Check the new SMTP demo.
  Thanks to Serge Wagener for locate this bug, track it down and
  send me the fix.
2/2/98

1.5.0
- Added the Canceled property to TSakPOP and to TSakSMTP.
  Due to this addition now RetrieveAllMessages is a function
  that return the number of msgs. retrieved and SendMessage is
  a boolean function (maybe someone has pressed the cancel btn).
- Fixed a bug when the subject field is too large.
9/2/98

1.5.1
- Fixed a bug with a message within a message (recursive msgs).
18/2/98

1.5.2
- Fixed a bug what happens when after the field 'To:' appear a
  blank line(Thanks to Osvaldo Fillia). Fixed a bug when sending 
  email to more than two address (the separator is still ',').
9/3/98

1.6.0
- Sometimes the filenames of an attachment contain invalid
  chars making very dificult to open a TSaveDialog (you have
  noted this ?), now SakEmail deletes the invalid chars.
- Applied a patch from Matjaz Bravc, that resolve the 
  problem of localized dates, letting you choose (in design 
  time) if you want localized dates (NOT recommended) or 
  standards dates (english) via the LocalizedDates boolean 
  property in the TSakSMTP comp. Thanks also to Serge Dosyukov 
  for sending me a fix.
- Also I applied another patch of Gregor Duchalski that cure 
  a bug with PChar when this unit is used under NT. 
- It seems that some machines need more delay when sendig a 
  msg (see previous posting 19/12/97), thanks to Matjaz Bravc.
- I discover a bug in the transparency code, it is fixed 
  now.
  Did you see the benefits of Open Source Software ? :)
26/3/98

1.6.1
- Added a FUNCFileName private variable to manage the complete
  path of the attached file. I receive problems reports with 
  this, it work now ?.
- Reduced the line sleep to 30 (tell me if this value doesn't
  work for you).
27/4/98

1.7.0
- Fixed a memory leak, thanks to Don Higgins.
- Moved the string esErrorInFormatOfMsg to a property of 
  SakPOP.
- Because some people need to use IP addresses instead of 
  Host names, I've added a new property IPAddress to SakPOP and 
  SakSMTP. If both are filled, then the Host name	will be used, 
  thanks to Roger F. Reghin for reporting this. The side effect 
  for this is that YOUR app must check if the host is a host 
  name or a IP address, in my app I remove the periods and try
  to convert the result to a float (long integers don't work,
  but float accept chars 'e') if it doesn't work I assume that 
  is a host name (someone has a better and simple idea ?).
- Added the property FileStream to the class TAtachedFile 
  and the procedure SaveToStream, this was done by Brian Sheperd
- The address separator (in the TO: field) is ',' and ';' 
  now (before it was ',' only).

1.7.1
- Roger F. Reghin has sended me a pair of nice patches that 
  resolve in a good behavior when the destination address is
  something like "Roger Reghin" <rreghin@hotmail.com> and some
  servers says that they couldn't relay that mail, etc.
  Also Roger has made the IPAddress property obsolete (do not 
  use it, use Host instead), SakEmail will resolve the host
  properly no matter if it is a host name or a IP address.
  So in the next version I will remove the IPAddress property.
  Thank you, Roger.

1.8.0
- Well, it seems that I made a mistake, I investigated the 
  previous behavior and it is a fault of the SMTP (RFC 821), so 
  I fixed it.
- The IPAddress property has been removed, use Host.
  Goeran Strehl (asem) has sended me a patch that fix a memory
  leak and one problem with the object inspector and the Text 
  property of a SakMsg.
  Dmitry Bondarenko say that some servers do not send the msg 
  size after the RETR command, so he fix that issuing a LIST n
  command first (work nicely).
- Added the property CC (Carbon Copy) to the SakMsg object.

1.8.1
- Added the property ReturnPath to the SakMsg comp.
  Minor changes to the scanning code for the filename of 
  attachments.

1.8.2
- Fixed a bug with the filename of attachments (thanks to
  Taufer Pavel Ing.).
- Added the function IsIPAddress from hou yg (the actual code
  don't work if the server is 265.net :)
  Fixed a minor bug with html pages like attachments.
  Some fucking email server return a bounded message declaring
  the boundary like 'boundary = ' and not 'boundary=' wich
  is clear in the RFC, fixed.

1.8.3
- A obscure bug was found by HuangYeJun from china, in the
  RetrieveHeaders function if the retrieved text was larger
  than 1024 bytes and the crlf.crlf fall in the middle of 
  two chunks, the function is blocked.
  I don't use this function, btw.

1.8.3.1
- Just cleaned up a bit the FindUUAtachs function. Not bug 
  or enhancements release. Serge Wagener put me to work >:|

1.8.4
- Dmitry Bondarenko (again) has found a bug in wich I do not 
  respect the RFC, wich say that replys from the SMTP server 
  could be multi-line, and the previous version just manage 
  as far as two lines. He also send me a nice patch, so the 
  bug is fixed.
- Craig Manley added a ExtraHeaders property, please, use with
  care, it's just not valid to put inside it whatever thing.
- The CC header was not being added to the headers that were 
  being sent, so Craig fixed it.
- Warning: I've put try/except in the TSakPOP.Connect and
  TSMTP.Connect function around the line FSocket.Open, so
  you will need to write something like:
      myPOP.Connect;
      if POPError then ...
  in your code, the old way was:
      try
        myPOP.Connect;
      except
	.....
      end;

  If you are strongly opossed to this change, drop me a line
  and tell me why (I'm in doubts).

1.8.5
- Greg Nixon added the priority property. The default priority
  for each msg created will be prNormal, so you don't need
  to change your code any bit.

1.8.6
- Ulf Sturegren has added D4 compatibility, not many changes to
  the source (one letter), but he found the error.
- Hou yg has sent to me a revisited IsIPAddress function, so
  I put the newer function in, infortunely my reply to him
  doesn't want to go.

1.8.7
- Ok, I discovered a weird bug, some old emailers (navigator 2)
  does not format the message in multipart mode if people send
  an attach, without writing any text and with no MIME settings.
  Fixed. This could be serious, I recommend upgrading.

1.8.8
- A small fix with the CC field. Some stupid mail servers put
  tabs in some fields (CC:, TO:) when they want to make a new
  line,	the correct is to put at least a space in the beginning 
  of the line, added a little code to "fix" that.

1.8.9
- Some 'moderns' pop3 servers doesn't support the LAST command,
  so I've added a little code to cope with this and added a 
  boolean property ServerSupportLastCmd. See TSakPOP.Init for 
  more details.
  Reported by Jan Najvarek.

1.9.0
- Kaufman Alex has added two properties to the SakMsg object,
  the ContentType and the Headers property, that should be self
  explaining (I modified a little the code he sended me, btw).

1.9.1
- I rewrote and greatly simplified the code that deal with the 
  multiple address in the TO: field and remove some possible
  bugs in it.

1.9.2
- Alex discovered and fix a bug when a file attached is not 
  enclosed between quotes, resulting in the filename without 
  the first and last character.

1.9.3
- Better detection of the boundary in multipart messages.
  Fixed a bug when the attached file is empty.

1.9.4
- Chris Günther send me *lots* of memory leaks fixes, very good
  job, Chris. 
- Some weird PGP messages are now processed well.
- Yang Qiandong from china fixed a compiler hint and a warning.
- Modified TSakSMTP.FReceiveTextFromSocket as suggested by Greg
  Nixon.
- Dmitry Bondarenko send me a patch that fixes some issues with
  the LAST command (that some servers don't implement) and other
  patch	that fixes a problem when servers add spare words in the
  tail of the answer.
- Some minor changes suggested by Matthew Vincent.
- Support for _big_ attachments files (me).
- Make the code more modular and simple (still is not very 
  modular).

1.10.0

- Do the rigth job if the ContentType is 'plain/text' and 
  the encoding is base64.
- Redone sak_ExtractAddress and sak_ExtractAlias.
- New 'Sender' property in SakMsg (normally not used,
  so do not use it, unless you know what you are doing)
  'Thanks' to Alex Kaufman for this.

- A *severe* bug with multiple addresses was fixed.

2.0.4
- Fixed bogus Message-number (Message-id is the correct)
  Thanks to Peter Honan

  (two cr).
- Fix function IsIpAddress.

  (ugly bug, fix from Alex Kaufman)

2.4.0
- I've revamped TSakMsg, many funcionality from SakPOP was
  moved to SakMsg, where it belongs.
- Now SakMsg has a RawMail property wich you may find useful,
  now you can do:
   SakMsg1.RawMail.LoadFromFile('(uidl).mail');
   SakMsg1.ParseMsg;
  or
   SakMsg1.RawMail.LoadFromStream( myStream);
   SakMsg1.ParseMsg;
  or
   SakMsg1.RawMail.SaveToFile( '(uidl).mail');
  etc, etc...
- Added a property TSakMsg.ClearRawMailAfterParse for memory
  saving.
- the return of the f* sleep line (it causes freezes on 
  winsock 1.1 systems like win95, win98 has winsock 2 so 
  there is no problem if you remove the line)
- lost of the DecodeProgess events :(
  (sorry, I don't know how to fit this events on the new
  SakMsg)

2.6.0
- the sleep() line is dead, it will never come back.
  Sending an email is a pleasure now.
- SakMsg has a TextEncoding (8Bit, Base64) property,
  I think this will be useful to people with others
  charset than iso-8859-1
- the base64 routines have been rewritten, they are
  more OO and faster (they are now in SakMIME.pas).
- cosmetic changes all over the place.

2.6.1
- simplifyed ParseMsg2 a lot, it work better now.
- speed up the search for uucoded attachs
  (the previous search was very dumb)
- fixed bug Msg.SizeInBytes always 0
- added a couple of Application.ProcessMessages to
  make the app more responsive.

2.6.2
- moved some functions from sak_utils to SakMIME.
- make const parameters all over the place.
- fix the bug that introduces a final crlf in
  quoted-printable attachs.
- fix a division by zero if attached file is 0
  bytes long, fixed by Peter Kollanyi.

2.6.3
- fix a rare bug when the header of a email (more
  probably a encapsulated one) has first line/s in
  blank. Easy and innocuous bug.

2.6.4
- fix the bug that insert the attachs of type text/*
  on the body of the email.
- change the Smtp.SendMessage for Smtp.SendTheMessage
  to avoid a BCBuilder problem.
  Both problems reported by Andreas Franzen.
  SendMessage is still there, but it's now deprecated,
  I will remove it in the future.

2.6.5
- moved the ParseMsg activation from SakPOP to SakMsg (where
  it belong), this means that after setting the RawMail
  property of SakMsg, this does a ParseMsg automatically.
  before:
	SakMsg1.RawMail := ...
	SakMsg1.ParseMsg;
  now:
	SakMsg1.RawMail := ...
  hope I'm not breaking too much code out there ...   :)
- some changes in the way attachments are processed (now
  the html part is separated correctly and images within
  the html are recognized)
- RetrieveMessage() and RetrieveMessageOnlyHeaders() now
  take an additional parameter, a TSakMsg var, so people
  can change some parameters before parsing, see the source
  in SakPOP3.pas (the old way is still supported, but they
  will be removed in the future)
- bug fixes that I do not remember.


3.0.0
- moved code around.
- removed deprecated functions (I told you about this)
- new SakAttFile unit.
- Base64Encode( AttFile), Base64Decode( AttFile), UUDecode( AttFile)
  has been moved to the TAtachedFile object, so you can do
  AttFile.Base64Encode, AttFile.Base64Decode, etc
- SakSMTP have lost EncodeStart, EncodeProgess and EncodeEnd events
  as a consequence of the previous change.
- SakPOP.Canceled and SakSMTP.Canceled properties have been made
  read-only and SakPOP.Cancel and SakSMTP.Cancel procedures (or methods)
  have been added.
- add a SakMsg.FillRawMail method that will fill the RawMail property
  with a rfc822 message based on the properties of SakMsg.
- changed SakSMTP.Quit & SakPOP.Quit to Disconnect
- deleted TAttachedFile.FileStream (redundant), use BodyBin
- removed the function sak_getTempFileName (as it should no be trusted)
  use function sak_GetTempPath

- the new SakIMAP component !, this make a pleasure to work with
  incoming emails (as you can have folders, etc).
  Note: the IMAP component has only been tested with the Uni. of
        Washington server, but it should work with any *STANDARD COMPLIANT*
        server.
        Anyways, the code of this component is very simple, so if you
        have problems, a look in the source code can enligthen you.

3.0.1
- fixed a brown paper type of bug.

3.0.2
- support the case where attachs do not come from files (Lars Karlslund)
- minor bugfix in UUDecode function (Lars Karlslund)
- if the SakMsg.Username is empty, do a VRFY command at the smtp server 
  to try to get the full user name (sergio)
- function TSakIMAP.GetFolderList (Peter Nagel)
- function TSakIMAP.GetHierarchyDelim (Peter Nagel)
- frustrated intent (ie. commented out) to remove memory leaks in POP, 
  SMTP & IMAP destroy functions (Ronald Moesbergen)

3.0.3
- actually create (and free) the FolderList in sakIMAP (Neculau Andrei)
- try to send the FQDM to the HELO command in SMTP (sergio)
- commented out the VRFY command in SakSMTP, and cut the from address
  in the From field (in SakMsg), so if the username is empty, the SMTP 
  server rewrite the from address in a complete way, with username & full 
  address (sergio)
- fix a minor bug in TBase64DecodingStream.Write function (Lars Karlslund)
