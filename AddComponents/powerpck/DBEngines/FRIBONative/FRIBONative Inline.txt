Only Builder 4&5 Projects I am afraid. IBO40_FRIB_C4 & 5.

Built in line with other IBObjects add-on's, it is saved as $(BCB)\Projects\IBO4\FRIBO\*.*
and uses the $(BCB)\Projects\Bpl, $(BCB)\Projects\Lib, and $(BCB)\Projects\IBO4\inter.


If someone can provide Delphi versions I will add them in, but I don't do Delphi.

This is a very rough cut, but it works.

It creates an IB_Connection and an IB_Query component on the FastReport Dialog tool bar.

Both work into Jason's SQLEditor and QueryEditor, so nothing much to learn.

I only needed to be able to create a single on the fly query, and it does that fine.


'Bugs' seen so far.

1/ Password needs to be added to the component if you don't want the connection dialog to keep poping up.
( I need to work out how the get Geoff's password stuff managed )

2/ Insert data field list has duplicate entries, but the real Query one's work fine. 

3/ The connection entry does not always appear in the ObjectInspector entry, but is connected.

4/ It does not do Parameters In as yet ( I said it was rough ).
