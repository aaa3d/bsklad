<h2>Events, General</h2>
<hr>

<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="width: 40%;"><font color="DarkBlue">OnFileUnload</font></td>
      <td>Event fired before view mode has been changed and before a new file has been opened using Open method.<br>
      Should be used to perform some file finalization, like saving of current file position.<br>
      Note:
      <ul>
      <li> If you don't close currently opened file on application closing, this event is not fired.
      So you may need to additionally call its handler in your form's OnClose event.
      </li></ul>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font color="DarkBlue">OnFileLoad</font></td>
      <td>Event fired after view mode has been changed and after a new file has been opened using Open method.<br>
      Should be used to perform some file post-initialization, like restoring of previously saved file position.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><font color="DarkBlue">OnOptionsChange</font></td>
      <td>Event fired after some option has been changed by a user.<br>
        Examples of such changable options:
        <ul>
        <li> Text encoding can be changed using right-click menu
        <li> Text and image scale can be changed using Ctrl + Mouse wheel
        </ul>
